    <h1>Welcome to <em>TypeFight!</em></h1>
    <p>
      <em>TypeFight!</em> is a game where you fight opponents through the eyes
      of your own robot. What makes this game unique is its requirement that
      all moves be entered via a command line interface; in other words, your
      robot fighter does whatever you type!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some tips to help you get started on your way to victory.
    </p>

    <h1>Your HUD Explained</h1>
    <p>
      Please consult the below image for an overview of different parts of the
      game heads-up display (HUD):

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Your health.</strong>
        If this is reduced to zero, you lose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your opponent's health.</strong>
        If you can reduce this to zero, you win.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your opponent.</strong>
        Your job is to punch his lights out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your left arm.</strong>
        You can punch and block with this arm separately from the right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your right arm.</strong>
        Like the left arm, this one can attack and block on its own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Command entry.</strong>
        This is where you tell your robot fighter what to do. Quickly type in
        commands and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to send them.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Commands</h1>
    <p>
      Everything you can do in <em>TypeFight!</em> is done by entering a
      command using your keyboard and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute. See
      the below table for a partial list of some commands you can enter.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Command</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>punch</code></td>
        <td>A basic punching attack.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>jab</code></td>
        <td>Like <code>punch</code>, but faster to type (if slightly weaker).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>open palm strike</code></td>
        <td>A weak strike.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>haymaker</code></td>
        <td>A strong punch coming from the side. You can only aim this attack
        from the <code>left</code> or <code>right</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>uppercut</code></td>
        <td>A strong punch coming aimed upwards. You can only aim this attack
        at the <code>center</code> of the target.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>block</code></td>
        <td>Raises your arm(s) to block one incoming attack.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>unblock</code></td>
        <td>Lowers your arm(s) back into a fighting stance.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Note that some commands have shorter <em>aliases</em> which can make them
      faster to type. Here's a free one: <code>open palm strike</code> can also
      be typed as <code>op</code>, which lets you use the move much faster!
    </p>
    <p>
      Attacks and blocks also should have a direction inputted either before or
      after the command. The direction will generally be one of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>left</code></li>
      <li><code>right</code></li>
      <li><code>center</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So to throw a left jab, you can type either <code>left jab</code> or
      <code>jab left</code>. Blocking an attack coming in from the right is
      achieved by entering either <code>block right</code> or <code>right block</code>
      . If you leave off the direction, <code>center</code> is assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be an effective fighter, you must observe your opponent carefully. Your
      opponents will often telegraph their attacks, and they can block yours as
      well. Pick the right action and direction, and type it quickly to perform
      it in time. But be careful! Unrecognized commands, such as those with
      typos, won't do anything other than leave you open to attack.
