# *Type Fight!*
A Game Design class project with fighting robots controlled by typing. Implemented with Pygame.

This is a first-person fighting game where you control your robot fighter with a series of typed-out commands. Your opponents are a series of AI-controlled robots with their own individual fighting styles, faced in increasing difficulty order.
